# Big Mart Sales Prediction
[Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/Anujjadaun97/Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction/blob/main/Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction.ipynb)
## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts **item sales** for Big Mart outlets using historical sales data.
[Big Mart Sales data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data)
It applies **machine learning regression techniques** to analyze and forecast sales based on various product and store attributes.

The primary objective is to help retailers improve inventory planning, pricing, and sales strategies.

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing data, encode categorical variables
2. **EDA** – Identify trends, patterns, and correlations
3. **Feature Engineering** – Create new meaningful variables
4. **Model Selection** – Train regression models such as:

   * Linear Regression
   * Decision Tree Regressor
   * Random Forest Regressor
   * Gradient Boosting
5. **Model Evaluation** – Compare metrics like RMSE and R²
6. **Prediction** – Generate sales forecasts
